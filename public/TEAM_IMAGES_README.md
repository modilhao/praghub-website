# Team Section Placeholder

This is a placeholder for team images. In a production environment, you would replace these with actual photographs of your pest control teams.

The current implementation uses:
- SVG placeholders for team-1.svg, team-2.svg, team-3.svg
- WebP format references (team-1.webp, team-2.webp, team-3.webp) 
- PNG fallbacks (1.png, 2.png)

For optimal performance, provide images in these formats:
- team-1.webp: 320x200px, WebP format
- team-2.webp: 320x200px, WebP format  
- team-3.webp: 320x200px, WebP format

The code includes proper fallbacks and error handling for missing images.
